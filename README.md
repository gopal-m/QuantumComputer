Quantum Computer (Insert Cool Name Here)
=====================================
Currently, only have qubit entanglement and measurement working.
Uses lazy evaluation to save memory.



Running
--------------------
Only tested on python 2.7
###Requires numpy 
To install it hopefully should be as easy as : 
	
``` bash
pip install numpy
```

I use virtual-env to maintain my packages, makes things easier.


### To Run
Right now theres only a simple example in main.py. Demonstrates entanglement and measurement. To run simply call in the right directory:
	
```bash
python main.py
```
